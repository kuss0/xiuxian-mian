# Full Stability Review and Rebuild

## Objective and Evidence

Complete Review -> Rebuild -> Test -> Final Review for the whole automation
service. Passing existing tests alone does not establish correct operation.
Each corrected behavior needs a reproducer, a state-transition assertion, and
evidence that cancellation, restart, or stale input cannot repeat its effects.

Baseline: `a41409fd15ea6e1d62c87dc4cca25abb38c82700`, production branch `main`.
Candidate: `rebuild/stability-20260907` in
`/root/xiuxian-main-rebuild-20260907`.

The existing quiz-bank edits and untracked `tools/dump_ui_write_keys.py` were
copied into the candidate for source parity. They remain user-owned and must
not be included in implementation commits by accident. No credentials, live
sessions, or live database were copied. Tests use temporary data directories.

Initial live check: main service, health observer, and watchdog are active;
listener is inactive; main service `NRestarts=0`. This is a checkpoint, not
proof that gameplay is healthy. Production files have not been changed.

## Requirements and Acceptance Matrix

| Area | Required behavior | Evidence required | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lifecycle | Startup, shutdown, reconnect, and task cancellation preserve pending work and release resources | Supervisor and async lifecycle failure tests; bounded live observation | Review in progress |
| Sending | No duplicate side effects after queue expiry, uncertain send, toggle-off, or cancellation | Reproducers spanning enqueue, await, transport result, and business transition | Pending |
| Reply routing | Exact identity/chat ownership; manual actions and edits reconcile once; broadcasts do not establish send health | Cross-chat, multi-account, out-of-order and duplicate-event replay | Pending |
| Scheduling | Every active module honors its own switch, authoritative cooldown, prerequisites, and mutual exclusion | Module inventory; enabled/disabled and resource-boundary tests | Pending |
| MiniApp | Current public entry, bounded reconnect, shared rate limits, isolated sessions; no blind mutation replay | HTTP/browser fault tests; public-entry and scheduler integration tests | Pending |
| Gameplay | Tianxing, duel, retreat, Yinluo/Wanxin, concubine, small world, fishing, tree, tower, trials, and remaining modules close their state transitions correctly | Per-module review and realistic response fixtures, including failure paths | Pending |
| Persistence | Atomic saves, compatible reloads, bounded history, no secret/test-state leakage | Crash/reload, corrupted-state, retention, and test-isolation checks | Pending |
| UI/control | Saved settings match runtime behavior; no stale-response overwrite or unintended send; access controls hold | API and browser/control contract checks | Pending |
| Operations | Reproducible dependencies, usable diagnostics, distinguish business failure from transport failure | Clean-environment tests and current health evidence | Pending |
| Final review | Revisit every finding and changed contract; record real residual limits | Full suite, targeted fault replay, diff review, deployment comparison | Not started |

## Preserved Operating Decisions

- Public MiniApp entry and group commands coexist. Select transport per module;
  a group sending problem alone must not globally disable available MiniApps.
- Deep retreat does not consume or block Tianxing effects.
- World Boss remains disabled unless the user separately asks to enable it.
- CommandAttempt remains an evidence ledger, not a retry/recovery controller.
  Gate 4 is outside the approved operational scope.
- Resource-spending actions need verified results and bounded recovery.
- Inventory API reads remain explicit UI operations, not background polling.
- Do not activate the inactive listener as a side effect of deploying fixes.
- Preserve the user's live switches, identities, equipment, and unrelated edits.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Finding and reproduction | Candidate status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R01 | High | `official_schedule.py` list/delete RPCs reference an undefined `runtime`; both new RPC tests failed with NameError | Fixed; account fallback also removed; focused tests pass |
| R02 | High | `config.py` computes data/session/state paths before reading `.env`; isolated import creates the wrong directories | Fixed; subprocess test verifies effective paths and absence of stray default data |
| R03 | High | Test-mode config still imports unspecified fields from project `.env` and can call public IP services | Fixed; subprocess tests reject credential import and external requests |
| R04 | High | Global pause, shutdown quiesce, and route-protection changes during entity resolution are not checked before SendMessageRequest | Fixed; one shared validation function at all three boundaries; 308 related tests and 11 subtests pass |
| R05 | Medium | Cancelling `_run_account_rpc` before acquiring its account lock leaves the supplied coroutine unclosed | Fixed; coroutine lifecycle regression passes |
| R06 | Medium | MiniApp retries omit all backoff/Retry-After waits when no custom sleeper is supplied | Fixed; default-sleeper 429/503 regressions pass; 265 MiniApp tests and 12 subtests pass |
| R07 | High | Cancelling a caller after its shielded send RPC starts can abandon result tracking while the RPC continues | Source-path confirmed; deterministic reproducer and correction pending |
| R08 | High | Generic pending-log recovery closes a pending task and action guard without replaying the owning business handler | Source-path confirmed; integration reproduction and correction pending |
| R09 | Medium | Shutdown cancels identity/background tasks without consistently joining them before final state save | Review in progress; cancellation and final-save ordering need fault tests |
| R10 | Medium | No dependency lock or static undefined-name gate; baseline tests did not cover broken official-schedule RPCs | Clean dependency install, `pip check`, Ruff and full suite pass; CI workflow added but not yet run remotely |

Inventory: 284 tracked Python files, approximately 271k lines including tests;
no duplicate top-level Python definitions found by AST inspection. Static
undefined-name/redefinition checks found R01 plus a duplicate `deque` import,
and are green after the candidate fixes. These checks do not establish business
correctness or complete the whole-project review.

The existing fixture/readiness report covers 106 of 108 active reply families.
`hehuan_escape` and `wanxin_moon_join` lack registered real-message samples;
five monitor/control-only contracts need separate behavioral verification.

## Verification Log

- Baseline full-suite run completed in the isolated worktree, with
  `XIUXIAN_ALLOW_LIVE_TEST_DB=0` and a local explicit UI base URL.
- Baseline JUnit output: `/tmp/xiuxian-rebuild-baseline-20260907.xml`.
- Baseline result: 3727 passed, 575 subtests passed, 60.74 seconds.
- Foundation candidate in a newly created Python 3.13 venv, installed only
  from `requirements-dev.txt`: 3738 passed, 579 subtests passed, 55.86 seconds.
  JUnit: `/tmp/xiuxian-rebuild-clean-env-20260907.xml`. `pip check`, selected
  Ruff checks across all code/tests/tools, and `git diff --check` pass.
- Live settings remain unchanged: global enabled, World Boss disabled globally
  and on all 24 identities, automatic incense refinement disabled on all
  identities. The production worktree still contains only the two original
  user changes.
- Production read-only database checkpoint: 24 identities, zero pending tasks,
  53 MiB DB; shadow ledger has 19113 sent/open, 3784 blocked/open,
  25 send_unknown/open, and 2 queued/open rows. Open-ledger capacity is still
  a review item; these counts do not authorize business recovery or deletion.
- No live game commands or configuration writes have been issued for this review.

## Completion Gate

Do not mark the objective complete while any matrix row lacks its required
evidence, a confirmed finding is unresolved, or candidate and deployed behavior
have not been reconciled. Unavailable external-game evidence must be reported
explicitly rather than replaced with a passing mock test.
